He is interested in the general area of scientific computing, particularly numerical analysis of ordinary and delay differential equations, stability analysis of (discretized) dynamical systems - including variable coefficient and switched systems - and ode methods in matrix perturbation theory and control, for high-dimensional problems. More specifically: Stiff and singularly perturbed problems (in particular in the framework of delay differential equations); software development for general classes of implicit delay differential equations; stability analysis of numerical integrators for ordinary and delay differential equations; computation of the joint spectral characteristics of a set of matrices, with application to contractivity analysis of time dependent systems of differential and difference equations; ode-based pseudospectral computations for both unstructured and structured problems; non-smooth analysis of discontinuous differential equations with focus on the computation of weak solutions. Francesco Tudisco Francesco Tudisco is assistant professor in the School of Mathematics at GSSI. His research interests lie at the intersection between matrix theory, scientific computing, network analysis and machine learning. In my work I develop new theorems and accompanying computational tools to address issues which originate from real-world applications that involve data streams. In particular, some of the fields he is currently working on are: higher-order data mining, spectral methods for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, community and core-periphery detection in networks, spectral theory for discrete graphs, nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory, tensor methods and tensor eigenvectors, multilayer graph clustering and centrality.

However, an emergent field of interest is systems of ODEs with discontinuous right hand side and many applications can be found in control theory (bang-bang controls), mechanical systems (dry friction) biology (gene regulatory networks), chemistry (gas liquid models). In most mathematical models described by discontinuous ODEs the vector field is piecewise smooth in subregions separated by manifolds and discontinuities take place across the manifolds. The existence and uniqueness of solutions are not anymore guaranteed at such interfaces and the classical Filippov theory becomes ambiguous when the discontinuity manifolds have co-dimension greater than 1. Infinitely many vector fields could be selected along the discontinuity manifolds and the corresponding solutions might have different qualitative behavior. This issue clearly affects also the numerical approximation of the solutions. Our aim is to investigate physical regularizations so to allow one to select a Filippov solution that has physical relevance. If we can show that the solutions of the regularized system converge uniformly to a particular Filippov solution, then we can select this solution for the discontinuous problem. The persistence of the qualitative behavior of solutions under regularization is fundamental if we wish to replace the discontinuous system with the regular one or viceversa, hence we will investigate this persistence as well. At the state of the art, numerical techniques for discontinuous problems, even though efficient, need to select a priori a sliding vector field in Filippov convex combination. Our studies would give rigorous theoretical justifications to make such selection in agreement with the original real life model that one wishes to simulate. Our research project focuses on getting new theoretical insight into numerical approaches and on exploiting this insight for the design and implementation of efficient algorithms. Computational analysis of complex networks Networks are a very powerful tool to model complex systems and analyze large data. For example, in exploratory data analysis we are often interested in finding clusters or communities, or assessing the importance (or centrality) of datapoints. As many real-world systems feature geographical, temporal, or categorical metadata and higher-order structures (motifs), models based on higher-order graphs such as hypergraphs, multilayer graphs and simplicial complexes are nowadays becoming prevalent. We are interested in developing both theoretical foundations and efficient algorithms for a range of network analysis problems. We are particularly interested in methods that exploit matrix and tensor representations of the data to approximately solve related combinatorial optimization problems such as community detection, clustering, core-periphery analysis. Spectral methods for machine learning Spectral methods play a fundamental role in machine learning, statistics, and data mining. Methods for foundational tasks such as clustering, semi-supervised learning, dimensionality reduction, latent factor models, ranking and preference learning and covariance estimation all use information about eigenvalues and eigenvectors (or singular values and singular vectors) from an underlying data matrix. Even though spectral methods are both powerful and convenient, they often rely on a linear approximation of the ideal learning problem which sometimes yields inaccurate results. We are interested in developing spectral methods that are based on nonlinear eigenvalue problems with eigenvector nonlinearities. This class of eigenvector methods is very broad and includes several nonlinear dimensionality reduction models and tight relaxation of cut functions, to name some. Moreover, it allows us to develop numerical linear algebra tools to efficiently perform the nonlinear spectral methods.","title":"Research"},{"location":"research/#research","text":"The research interests of this group include: Numerical integration of ODEs Numerical solution of nonlinear eigenvector problems Numerical linear algebra Computational data science Spectral graph theory Numerical Optimization Computational biofluid dynamics Analysis of complex networks and their applications to a wide range of real-world problems Some specific topics of interest are:","title":"Research"},{"location":"research/#numerical-integration-of-nonsmooth-dynamical-systems","text":"The numerical treatment of differential equations usually relies on smoothness assumptions which play a fundamental role in the development of suitable schemes and in their convergence analysis.
